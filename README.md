# citaPreviaPadron

An app I wrote to help myself get an appointment for the Padr√≥n de Habitantes de Torrevieja.

Current version visits the page every 15 minutes and logs the contents of the appointment calendar to MongoDB.

I already wrote the code which will get an appointment and tested that it works - it should just need plugging in to the task scheduler.
